The .NET Framework is designed to fulfill the following objectives:

<ul>
  <li class="fragment">
  To provide a consistent object-oriented programming environment whether object
  code is stored and executed locally, executed locally but
  Internet-distributed, or executed remotely.
  </li>
  <li class="fragment">
  To provide a code-execution environment that minimizes software deployment and
  versioning conflicts.
  </li>
  <li class="fragment">
  To provide a code-execution environment that promotes safe execution of code,
  including code created by an unknown or semi-trusted third party.
  </li>
</ul>
